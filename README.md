# BI
It is my first try to crate a page for Beta Index reliability software.
You can download the installer file of software from following link: 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/yn67c5a6bf1wekv/BetaIndex.exe?dl=0
After downloading the .exe file, install it by "Run as administrator".
Follow the steps and complete the setup. Then, you can use the BI. 
For start, You can use the Examples file placed in the Example folder.
For more information, visit the Help file placed in the Help folder.

Good luck.

Yours sincerely,
Mehrshad Ghorbanzadeh
